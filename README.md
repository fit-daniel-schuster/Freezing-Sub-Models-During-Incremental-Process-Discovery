# Freezing Sub-Models During Incremental Process Discovery

## About this repository
This repository contains raw data and visualizations from the experimental evaluation of the freezing approach proposed in the paper "Freezing Sub-Models During Incremental Process Discovery" 

## Structure
Each directory, e.g., `rtfm_1`, contains the results of a specific experiment.

1. visualization of an initial process tree with frozen subtree (marked in red) as `.svg` file 
2. various results in the corresponding `.csv` file
3. processed data/results in the `.xlsx` file
4. visualizations of all incrementally discovered process trees in the directory `tree_visualizations`.

For more information on the experimental setup, we refer to the paper.
